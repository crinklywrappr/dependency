Stuart Sierra's dependency library, but I started over using `deps-new` to get a feel for the new deps thing.

# Manual steps required (or things which could be in a template)

1. `deps-new` generates a `pom.xml` but this appears to be worthless - just delete it
2. The generated POM is still missing a lot of information.  See #template-pom for more info.


## template-pom

1. Create a `template/pom.xml` 
2. Reference in `build.clj` `ci` function eg `(assoc opts :src-pom "template/pom.xml")`.

Lots of caveats

1. The template file _requires_ the schema info on the `project` tag, otherwise the generated POM is unusable.
2. clojars uses the `scm` section to link back to github, and it isn't autogenerated from the reverse-domain groupid - You'll have to include it
3. Both build-clj and clojars expect a tag to be available, and by default build-clj writes it to the POM in a certain format. To be compliant, tag release commits with `vX.X.X`. The _v_ is important!
